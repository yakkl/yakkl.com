        <h2>The Gist</h2>
        <p>We, the folks at YAKKL, Inc. (YAKKL® ), are on a mission to make web3 a better place. We hope you love our products and services — from YAKKL®  Smart Vault to secure backup systems to management tools for distributed blockchain companies to the next great idea that we haven't even thought of yet — as much as we love creating them.
        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) describe our commitments to you, and your rights and responsibilities when using our services. Our Privacy Policy ("Privacy") describes our commitment to keep your Personal Information secure. Please read them carefully and reach out to us if you have any questions. <strong>These Terms include a mandatory arbitration provision in Section 16. If you don't agree to these Terms, don't use our services.</strong></p>

        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
        <p>These Terms govern your access to and use of the products and services we provide through or for YAKKL.com.</p>
        <p>Please read these Terms carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to be bound by all of the Terms and all other operating rules, policies, and procedures that we may publish via the Services from time to time (collectively, the “Agreement”). You also agree that we may automatically change, update, or add on to our Services, and this Agreement will apply to any changes.</p>

        <h2>1. Who's Who</h2>
        <p>“You” means any individual or entity using our Products/Services. If you use our Products/Services on behalf of another person or entity, you represent and warrant that you're authorized to accept the Agreement on that person's or entity's behalf, that by using using our Product/Services you&#39;re accepting the Agreement on behalf of that person or entity, and that if you, or that person or entity, violates the Agreement, you and that person or entity agree to be responsible to us.</p>

        <h2>2. Your Account</h2>
        <p><strong>IF</strong> using our Product/Services requires an account, you agree to provide us with complete and accurate information and to keep the information current so that we can communicate with you about your account. We may need to send you emails about notable updates (like changes to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy), or to let you know about legal inquiries or complaints we receive about the ways you use our Product/Services so you can make informed choices in response.
        We may limit your access to our Services until we're able to verify your account information, like your email address.</p>
        <p>When you create a YAKKL® account, we consider that to be an inquiry about our products and services, which means that we may also contact you to share more details about what we have to offer (i.e., marketing). Don't worry — if you aren't interested, you can opt out of the marketing communications, whether it's an email, phone call, or text message.</p>
        <p>You're solely responsible and liable for all activity under your account. You're also fully responsible for maintaining the security of your account (which includes keeping your password and secret phrase secure). We're not liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of your acts or omissions.</p>
        <p>Don't share or misuse your access credentials. And notify us immediately of any unauthorized uses of your account or of any other breach of security. If we believe your account has been compromised, we may suspend or disable it - depending on elected services.</p>
        <p>If you would like to learn about how we handle the data you provide us, please see our <a href="https://yakkl.com/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>3. Minimum Age Requirements</h2>
        <p>Our Services are not directed to children. You're not allowed to access or use our Services if you're under the age of 18. If you register as a user or otherwise use our Services, you represent that you're at least 18. You may use our Services only if you can legally form a binding contract with us. In other words, if you're under 18 years of age (or the legal age of majority where you live), you can only use our Services under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to the Agreement.</p>

        <h2>4. Responsibility of Accounts</h2>
        <p>We don't reviewed, and can't review, your account content. So, for example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We don't have any control over third-party websites or potential scammers.</li>
          <li>A link to or from one of our Services does not represent or imply that we endorse any third-party.</li>
          <li>We don't endorse any Content or represent that Content is accurate, useful, or not harmful. Content could be offensive, indecent, or objectionable; include technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, or other errors; or violate or infringe the privacy, publicity rights, intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights of third parties.</li>
          <li>You're fully responsible for the activities and transactions you perform, and any harm resulting from that. It's your responsibility to ensure that you are not doing anything illegal or potentially falling victom to scammers.</li>
          <li>We aren't responsible for any harm resulting from anyone's access, use, purchase, or downloading of Content, or for any harm resulting from third-parties. You're responsible for taking the necessary precautions to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.</li>
          <li>We follow encryption guidelines but do not store passwords or secret phrases in plain text. This means you MUST secure your password and secret phrase so you can recover your account and possibly your funds.</li>
          <li>We are not a party to, and will have no responsibility or liability for, any communications, transactions, interactions, or disputes between you and anyone else.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note that additional third-party terms and conditions may apply to Content you download, copy, purchase, send, receive or use.</p>

        <h2>5. Fees, Payment, and Renewal</h2>
        <h3>a. YAKKL® Fees (if any)</h3>
        <p><strong>Fees for Paid Services.</strong> Some of our Services may be offered for a fee. It will be very clear and require acknowledgement. By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees. Depending on the Paid Service, there may be one-time fees, recurring fees, transaction fees, or transaction/revenue-based fees. For recurring fees, we'll bill or charge you in the automatically-renewing interval (such as monthly or annually) you select, on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time by contacting the relevant support team.</p>
        <p><strong>Taxes.</strong> To the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, all fees do not include applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, value-added, goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges (“Taxes”). You're responsible for paying all applicable Taxes relating to your use of our Services, your sells, or your purchases. If we're obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the fees you've paid or will pay, you're responsible for those Taxes, and we may collect payment.</p>
        <p><strong>Payment.</strong> If your payment fails, Paid Services are otherwise not paid for or paid for on time (for example, if you contact your bank, credit card company or crypto exchange to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services), or we suspect a payment is fraudulent, we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to Paid Services without notice to you. Your crypto account is your crypto account and we have no access to it.</p>
        <p><strong>Automatic Renewal.</strong> To ensure uninterrupted service, recurring Paid Services are automatically renewed. This means that unless you cancel a Paid Service before the end of the applicable subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to use any payment mechanism we have on record for you, like credit cards or PayPal, or crypto to collect the then-applicable subscription fee as well as any Taxes. By default, your Paid Services will be renewed for the same interval as your original subscription period, so for example, if you purchase a one-year subscription for an advanced security plan, you'll be charged each year for access for another 12-month period. We may charge your account up to one month before the end of the subscription period to make sure pesky billing issues don't inadvertently disrupt your access to our Services. The date for the automatic renewal is based on the date of the original purchase and cannot be changed. If you've purchased access to multiple services, you may have multiple renewal dates.</p>
        <p>To review renewal dates and manage subscriptions for any other Paid Services, please consult the respective Service's website portal or contact the support team. You'll need to check your email (including in spam or other filters) for any reminder emails we might send you before your Paid Services renew.</p>
        <p><strong>Cancelling Automatic Renewal.</strong> You can manage and cancel any Paid Services at the respective Service's website portal.</p>
        <p>If auto-renew is successfully turned off, you'll see the date on which your subscription expires. If you have multiple Paid Services to cancel, repeat this process for each subscription.</p>
        <p><strong>Fees and Changes.</strong> We may change our fees at any time in accordance with these Terms and requirements under applicable law. This means that we may change our fees going forward, start charging fees for Services that were previously free, or remove or update features or functionality that were previously included in the fees. If you don't agree with the changes, you must cancel your Paid Service.</p>
        <p><strong>No-Show Policy.</strong> We may have a “no-show policy” for some Paid Services that require your participation. For instance, this may mean that if you don't show up or are late for a scheduled session or training, you'll still be charged and won't be entitled to a refund.</p>
        <p><strong>Refunds.</strong> We may have a refund policy for some of our Paid Services, and we'll also provide refunds if required by law. In all other cases, there are no refunds and all payments are final.</p>

        <h2>6. Feedback</h2>
        <p>We love hearing from you and are always looking to improve our Services. When you share comments, ideas, or feedback with us, you agree that we&#39;re free to use them without any restriction or compensation to you.</p>

        <h2>7. General Representation and Warranty</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to make the web3 a better place, and our Services are designed to give you control and ownership over your crypto and crypto related services.

          <li>Will not be for any unlawful purposes, to perform money laundrying, use account(s) to purchase or sell illegal items or services, or in furtherance of illegal activities;</li>
          <li>Will not be involved with any scamming activities of any kind;</li>
          <li>Will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of YAKKL® or any third party;</li>

          <li>Will not involve reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling, deciphering, or otherwise attempting to derive the source code for the Services or any related technology that is not open source; and</li>
