            <h3>About YAKKL, Inc.</h3>
            <p>YAKKL, Inc., a Delaware C Corporation, is an innovator in the intersection of Web 2, Web 3, and AI technologies, pioneering a new wave of digital communication and collaboration. Our flagship product, the YAKKL® Smart Vault, serves as a bridge to the burgeoning cryptocurrency market, offering advanced security, intuitive onboarding processes, and a feature-rich dApp API interface.</p>

            <h3>Investment Opportunities</h3>
            <p>As a privately-held corporation, YAKKL, Inc. is actively seeking Seed funding. Our preferred method for funding agreements is the SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) document from Y Combinator. This investment opportunity presents a unique opening to partner with us as we redefine "old style" digital wallets into true Vaults and catalyze the fusion of Web 2 and Web 3 technologies. Feel free to reach out to Investor Relations at investors@yakkl.com</p>
            
            <h3>Product and Strategy</h3>
            <p>The YAKKL® Smart Vault has been designed keeping user experience at its core. As Intereim CTO, Hans Jones puts it this way, our vision is as simple "1-2-3": "(1) Security, (2) User Experience, and (3) Integration. We prioritize robust security protocols and an intuitive user interface that encapsulates complex functionalities within one-click interactions. Moreover, our product strategy hinges on creating advanced, user-friendly integration points for dApps and traditional payment systems, aiming to establish a comprehensive Blockchain and Web 3 ecosystem."</p>

            <p>There are many ways we differ from the digital crypto wallet market. We're a Smart Vault for retail, business, and institutions. We're not like simple and basic wallets you find in the wild. Here are a few more of our many advantages:</p>
            <p><span class="underline">1. Security</span> - we use a combination of username and password (in certain cases - a passcode). All of the critical data is encyrpted at all times except for the brief moment it's needed. No transaction can be executed without an encyrpted verification by the user. For example, take almost any wallet on the market, login using only a simple password, select a crypto address in your wallet and send. Sounds simple, and it is. However, if a rogue actor or even someone you believe you may trust sees your wallet open, they can send all of your funds to any address they wish. With the YAKKL® Smart Vault, we require a verification from the account owner and we automatically lock the system.</p>
            
            <p>We even take secuirty to the next level with our Emergency Kit. The Emergency Kit will automatically bundle up all of your accounts, encrypt the data using the same encryption, and print a hardcopy to put into a secure place. The file itself can also be encrypted so it can be stored almost anywhere. The print out has the full instructions on how to simply go into YAKKL, click import and point to the secure file. It will then rebuild everything - far beyond simply entering a secret pass phrase manually. We also block all copy/paste so bad actors can't copy the user's private keys. We validate first and only allow copy via our copy icon. And even then, we start a timer and automatically clear the copy buffer to thwrat a known issue with some other wallets.</p>

            <p><span class="underline">2. UX (user experience)</span> - Mass adoption requires a much better user experience. It's simply hard to get onboarded, buy, trade, secure your funds, and even to operate! One of the design goals of YAKKL® was that everything that you would use on a daily basis would be visible at all times or no more than one-click away. No more digging through menu layers and still not finding what you need or it doesn't work as expected. In addition to visual side, normal operations are critical. Just in the past months, some of the "older" wallets were down because their access provider was down. We architected a number of access providers into YAKKL, not just one like others. We automatically rotate providers, if one fails then the transaction will be sent to the blockchain by another provider. Also, some providers can do more than others so we use the best provider for a given task.</p>

            <p><span class="underline">3. Integration</span> - Our goal is to be the Smart Vault of choice for all Web 3 dApps. The current market ingration available for dApps is somewhat basic and there may even be security concerns. We are on par with the market on the API/Services we provide to dApps. However, we are working on a secure and feature rich integration that the dApp may be able build their own unique integration points and maybe even white label YAKKL® or co-brand. The latter is a roadmap item.</p>

            <h3>Revenue Model</h3>
            <p>There are a number of ways we approach this and we would be happy to discuss this with qualified potential funding partners. With the new Fractional Economy and Tokenized world, the day of giving everything away for free will be coming to a close. Companies can longer afford to support that free model. Will somethings be given away? Where it makes the most sense. Is YAKKL® free? Currently, the Standard version is. Our Premier version has an annual nominal fee. We will be allowing early adopters to have access to the Premier version for free. It's a partnership with our users.</p>

            <h3>Team and Governance</h3>
            <p>At the helm of YAKKL, Inc., our Interim CTO Hans Jones, brings an extraordinary blend of technical proficiency and business leadership. Hans boasts a distinguished track record, visible on his LinkedIn profile (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanscj1" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanscj1</a>), where his feats of building and managing substantial international organizations are well-documented.</p>

            <p>His technical expertise shines through his work available on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/hanscj1" target="_blank">https://github.com/hanscj1</a>). Hans has had a hand in architecting, building, and contributing to high-profile projects from prestigious firms like Bloomberg, Hitachi, Adobe (contract), Accenture/AT&T (contract), and CNN, among others.</p>
              
            <p>YAKKL, Inc.'s governance is not just about leadership but about a shared vision and a commitment to uphold the highest levels of transparency, accountability, and sound corporate governance. This dedication permeates through our leadership, ensuring that we maintain public trust and adhere to the highest standards in our business operations. Each team member brings a unique blend of expertise and a shared vision for the future of digital technology.</p>
              
            <p>This strategic combination of experience, skill, and dedication forms the bedrock of YAKKL, Inc.'s continued success and positions us strongly for our future endeavors.</p>

            <h3>Roadmap</h3>
            <p>Our first product is the YAKKL® Smart Vault. Over the next year, YAKKL® security, advanced NFT features, more powerful AI features, and portfolio features will added. We have been asked "why start with the Smart Vault?". Simple, from experience building and scaling large systems, you start with the most difficult problem first. According to "CZ" from Binace, "the wallet is the most difficult thing to get right." Now, that we started our initial release cycle, we move on to a provider instructure model that can span and scale multiple cloud environments. This helps lower our costs overall and enhance one of our goals of being the provider (vault and infrastructure) of choice by all dApps. This then opens up even more opportunities that we can't discuss here.</p>
